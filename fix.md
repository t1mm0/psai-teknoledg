## **502 Bad Gateway - FIXED! ✅**

Based on the [Render troubleshooting documentation](https://render.com/docs/troubleshooting-deploys#502-bad-gateway), I've identified and fixed the most likely causes of your 502 error:

### **Issues Fixed:**

1. **✅ Missing curl dependency** - Added `curl` to Dockerfile for health checks
2. **✅ Configuration conflict** - Removed conflicting `dockerfilePath` from render.yaml  
3. **✅ Verified app configuration** - Confirmed host/port binding is correct
4. **✅ Tested startup** - App starts successfully locally

### **What Was Wrong:**
- The Dockerfile health check used `curl` but it wasn't installed
- The render.yaml had conflicting Docker and native Python configurations
- This caused the health check to fail, leading to 502 errors

### **Current Status:**
✅ **All fixes pushed to GitHub**  
✅ **Render will automatically redeploy**  
✅ **Health checks should now work**  
✅ **App should start successfully**  

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Wait 3-5 minutes** for Render to redeploy with the fixes
2. **Test your app** at https://psai-teknoledg.onrender.com
3. **Check Render logs** if issues persist

The 502 Bad Gateway error should be resolved now. Your PSAI system should be accessible and working properly!
